# AndreDVJ's fork of Jacky's AdvancedTomato-ARM #

AdvancedTomato-ARM firmware (which is a fork Tomato-ARM by Shibby)

This is my personal fork, where I attempt to fix issues, update open-source components if possible, and cherry-pick fixes from others.

This repository, while I try to keep aligned to Shibby's as much as possible, it has diverted already as some components are newer versions.

I only have a Netgear R7000 router. I don't have any other unit to test. Build/flash at your own risk.

If you see any issues, please let me know.
